Once upon a time there was a computer programmer named Jim and he loved his computer soooo much that it was his only friend. His parents were very worried about him and his hobbies that they tried to set him up on a blind date.
That day when Jim woke up, he had no idea that his life was about to turn upside down, Jim followed his daily morning ritual, and then went straight to fighting the enemy commonly know as bugs and being a good samaritan by helping out people on stackoverflow when suddenly he got a text message. The message was from his mother, when he read the message his eyes almost popped out of his sockets... 
The message read, "I met a girl that is a computer science major who would like to meet you! But she can only meet tonight". Jim didn't know what to think. On one hand he had the opportunity to meet the potential love of his life, while on the other hand he had a program to turn in by the end of the night. Suddenly, he had an idea. What if he could invite the girl over to work on the project with him? There was only one problem with this...

Once upon a time there was a computer programmer named Jim and he loved his computer soooo much that it was his only friend. His parents were very worried about him and his hobbies that they tried to set him up on a blind date.
That day when Jim woke up, he had no idea that his life was about to turn upside down, Jim followed his daily morning ritual, and then went straight to fighting the enemy commonly know as bugs and being a good samaritan by helping out people on stackoverflow when suddenly he got a text message. The message was from his mother, when he read the message his eyes almost popped out of his sockets...

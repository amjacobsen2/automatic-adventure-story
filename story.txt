Once upon a time there was a computer programmer named Jim and he loved his computer soooo much that it was his only friend. His parents were very worried about him and his hobbies that they tried to set him up on a blind date.
That day when Jim woke up, he had no idea that his life was about to turn upside down, Jim followed his daily morning ritual, and then went straight to fighting the enemy commonly know as bugs and being a good samaritan by helping out people on stackoverflow when suddenly he got a text message. The message was from his mother, when he read the message his eyes almost popped out of his sockets... 
The message read, "I met a girl that is a computer science major who would like to meet you! But she can only meet tonight". Jim didn't know what to think. On one hand he had the opportunity to meet the potential love of his life, while on the other hand he had a program to turn in by the end of the night. Suddenly, he had an idea. What if he could invite the girl over to work on the project with him? There was only one problem with this...
The program was supposed to be for his eyes only. If someone else contributed to it, Jim was sure to be in a boatload of trouble. Jim, the clever comp sci student that he is, came up with a great idea. Jim thought, "what if I had her write some inconsequential methods that wouldn't give the project away! Then I could hang out with her and get this project down without getting in trouble!. That would really do it!". But what methods could he give her? 
He could have her write black box testing methods! That was it! She wouldn't know the implementation at all, just the results which was okay. It was a brilliant idea, Jim thought to himself. He was now ready for his date.
